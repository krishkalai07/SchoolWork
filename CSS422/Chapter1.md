# Computer Architecture/Organization

Talks about hardware. Transparant to programmer

# IBM System 370 Architecture
- Was introduced in 1970
- Included a number of models
- Could upgrade to a more expensive, faster model without having to abandon original software
- New models are introduced with improved technology, but retain the same architecture so that the customer’s software investment is protected
- Architecture has survived to this day as the architecture of IBM’s mainframe product line

# Structure and Function

- Hierarchical system
  - Set of interrelated subsystems
- Hierarchical nature of complex systems is essential to both their design and their description
- Designer need only deal with a particular level of the system at a time
  - Concerned with structure and function at each level
- Structure
  - The way in which components relate to each other
- Function
  - The operation of indiviudal components as part of the structure

# Function
- 4 basic functions that can be performed:
  - Data processing
    - Data takes a wide varierty of forms and the range of processing requirements is broad
  - Data storage
    - Short-term (register, integrated to CPU)
    - Long-term (memory)
  - Data movement
    - I/O when data are recieved or delivered to a device that is directly connected to the computer.
    - *Move data between or within devices*
  - Control
    - A control unit manages the computer’s resources and orchestrates the performance of its functional parts in response to instructions

"You're instructing me to perform an instruction" - best line said so far.

## 4 main structural components of the computer
Refer to Slide 13

Component | Description
--------  | -----------
CPU | controls the operation of the computer and performs its data processing functions (Quad-Core Intel Xeon Processor with Memory controller / Ethernet controller)
Main Memory | stores data (DDR3-1333 Memory Interfaces)
I/O | moves data between the computer and its external enviornment (wires/ports)
System internconnection | some mechanism that provides for communication among CPU, main memory, and I/O (typically wires)

# CPU
Major Structural Component | Description
-------------------------- | -----------
Control unit | Controls the operation of the CPU and
hence the computer
Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) | Performs the computer’s data processing function
Registers | Provide storage internal to the CPU
CPU Interconnection | Some mechanism that provides for communication among the control unit, ALU, and registers
