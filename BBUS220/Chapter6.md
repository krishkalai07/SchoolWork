# Opportunity Cost
- Human as 2 job opportunities
  - Wash dishes for $6 for hour
  - Recycling aluminum cans in the alternative: 2c per can

- opportunity cost: $6
  - Recycle as long as he makes $6 per hour

## Recycling services

Hours per day | total number of container | additional cans | Revenue from additional cans
--- | --- | --- | ---
0 | 0 | - | -
1 | 600 | 600 | $12.00
2 | 2000 | 400 | $8.00
3 | 1300 | 300 | $6.00
4 | 1500 | 200 | $4.00
5 | 1600 | 100 | $2.00

Should collect cans for 3 hours, then wash dishes

Cans is now 4c per can

Hours per day | total number of container | additional cans | Revenue from additional cans
--- | --- | --- | ---
0 | 0 | - | -
1 | 600 | 600 | $24.00
2 | 2000 | 400 | $16.00
3 | 1300 | 300 | $12.00
4 | 1500 | 200 | $8.00
5 | 1600 | 100 | $4.00

Now stop at 4 hours

dishwashing is now $7, cans is 2c

stop at 2 hours a day

Human recycles more if
- can deposit increase
- dish-washing wage decreases

# Perfectly Competitive Market
- Main characteristic of a perfectly competitive market
  1. Many buyers and sellers
  2. Trade identical products
  3. Each buyer and seller is a price taker
  4. Firms and enter and exit the market

## Do we have a perfectly competitive market

Example | Close to a competitive market because | different because
--- | --- | ---
Farmers market | 1,3 | 2 (could be same) 

## Perfectly competitive Firm' Demand

if firms are price takers, they must choose quantities

# Business Decision-Making

- Consider a fast food restaurant
- Lots of information needed. Lots of decisions regarding inputs
  - Labor
    - Workers
    - Shifts
    - Wages
  - Capital
    - Fryers
    - Milkshake machines
    - Cash registers
  - Other inputs
    - Food supplies
    - Napkins
    - Tables

## Production - definitions
Term | Definition
--- | ---
Factor of production | an input used in a good or service (workers)
Production | converts inputs to outputs by using technology
Short run | period of time when at least one factor of production is fixed
Long run | period of time where all inputs are variable

## Diminishing Marginal Product of Labor 
- Run a fast food restaurant. increases in input eventually cause output to input at a slower rate
  - Laborer 1: total output 5
  - Laborer 2: total output 15, increase by 10
  - Laborer 3: total output 30, increase by 15
  - Laborer 4: total output 42, increase by 12
  - Laborer 5: total output 52, increase by 10

- Why
  - workers per machine
  - information flows

## Illustration of Diminishing MPL
- Ex: garbage collection
  - Fixed
    - Capital
    - Garbage truck
  - Variable
    - Labor
    - Workers
  - Output
    - Trash can is picked up

## Cost Concepts – Short run
Concept | definition
Fixed cost (FC) | <ul><li>The sum of all payments for fixed input</li><li>FC = </li></ul>
Variable cost (VC) | <ul><li>The sum of all payments for fixed input</li><li>FC = </li></ul>
Total cost (TC) | 
Marginal cost (MC) | 
Average cost (AVC AFC ATC/AC) | Fixed/Variable/Total/Marginal Cost divided by quantity

Q = 10 -> TC = 150

Q = 12 -> TC = 170 (MC = (170-150)/2 = 20/2 = 10)

| K = 1 ; capital (C reserved for costs)

| R = $100 ; rent

-> FC = KR = 1 * $100 = $100

| L = 5 ; laborers

| W = 10 ; wages

-> VC = LW = 5 * 10 = $50


## An example of Production and Costs in the Short Run
- Our model has:
  - A perfectly competitive market for bottles
  - A single product: bottles

- Two inputs
  - labor (variable)
  - capital (fixed in the short run) - 1 unit in example

- Price of input:
  - Wage: $12/day
  - Rent: $40/day

## Short run production and costs

(w = $12, rent = $40)

Workers | Bottles per day | Fixed cost | variable cost | total cost | marginal cost
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
0 | 0   | 40 | 0  | 40 |   |
1 | 80  | 40 | 12 | 52 | 0.15 |    
2 | 200 | 40 | 24 | 64 | 0.1 |    
3 | 260 | 40 | 36 | 76 | 0.20 |    
4 | 300 | 40 | 48 | 88 | 0.30 |    
5 | 330 | 40 | 60 | 100 | 0.4 |    
6 | 350 | 40 | 72 | 112 | 0.5 |    
7 | 362 | 40 | 84 | 124 | 0.6 |    

## Cost Curves
Workers per day | Bottles per day | variable cost | AVC | total cost | ATC | Marginal cost
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
0 | 0 | 0 |  | 40 |   |   |
1 | 80 | 12 | 0.15 | 52 | 0.65 | 0.15
2 | 200 | 24 | 0.12 | 64 | 0.32 | 0.1
3 | 260 | 36 |  0.135 | 76 | 0.292 | 0.2

## Margin and Average Relationship
Game | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5
---  | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Marginal | 45 | 15 | 21 | 27  | 42 
Average | 45 | 30 | 27 | 27  | 30

## Well – Behaved Cost Curves

# Profit Maximization
- profit = total\_revenue - total\_cost
- profit = total\_revenue - (variable\_cost + fixed\_cost)

- To maximize profits, the firm must produce the quantity where the total revenue minus the total cost is greatest
  - if MR > MC, firm should increase output
  - if MR < MC, firm should decrease output
  - if MR = MC, firm should profit-maximizing level of output

## Profit maximization for a competitive firm
(graph)

## Profit Maximization & Competitive Firm’s Supply Curve
- Measuring profit
  - π = TR - TC = (P - ATC) * Q
  - if P > ATC, firm will earn positive profits (π > 0)
  - if P < ATC, firm will earn negative profits (π < 0)
  - if P = ATC, firm will earn zero profits (π = 0)

## Profit as the area between price and average total cost

## Short run and long run decisions
- Shutdown
  - (Closed for winter)
  - Short-run decision to not produce anything
    - During a specific period of time
    - Because of current market conditions
    - Firm still pays fixed costs
- Exit
  - (Going out of business)
  - Long-run decision to leave the market
  - Sunk costs

## Shut-Down Decision
- Cost-Benefit principle applies even to losses
- Shut down if your losses are less than if you continued operating
- Shut down if your VC > TR

# Long run equilibrium in a Competitive Market
- Long run: firms can enter and exit the market
- if existing firms make positive profit
  - new firms can enter the market
- if existing firms make negative profit
  - Forms exit the market
  - Supply decreases raising the eq. price and profits
- process of entry and exit ends when
  - Firms still in market

## Long-run market equilibrium

(diagram)

# Producer Surplus
- Producer surplus is the difference between the market price and the seller's reservation price
- Producer surplus is the area above the supply curve and below the market price

(diagram): PS = 1/2 * (2.00 - 0) * (4 - 0) = 4 1000's $'s per day


# Additional Notes
- Price curve: Demand (individual)
- Marginal cost (supply)
- ATC cuts through min(MC)
- π = (P-ATC) * Q
