3. Production and cost concepts
4. Profit-maximizing output and profit in the short run5.Long run equilibrium in a competitive market
6. Producer surplus

# Opportunity Cost
- Human as 2 job opportunities
  - Wash dishes for $6 for hour
  - Recycling aluminum cans in the alternative: 2c per can

- opportunity cost: $6
  - Recycle as long as he makes $6 per hour

## Recycling services

Hours per day | total number of container | additional cans | Revenue from additional cans
--- | --- | --- | ---
0 | 0 | - | -
1 | 600 | 600 | $12.00
2 | 2000 | 400 | $8.00
3 | 1300 | 300 | $6.00
4 | 1500 | 200 | $4.00
5 | 1600 | 100 | $2.00

Should collect cans for 3 hours, then wash dishes

Cans is now 4c per can

Hours per day | total number of container | additional cans | Revenue from additional cans
--- | --- | --- | ---
0 | 0 | - | -
1 | 600 | 600 | $24.00
2 | 2000 | 400 | $16.00
3 | 1300 | 300 | $12.00
4 | 1500 | 200 | $8.00
5 | 1600 | 100 | $4.00

Now stop at 4 hours

dishwashing is now $7, cans is 2c

stop at 2 hours a day

Human recycles more if
- can deposit increase
- dish-washing wage decreases

# Perfectly Competitive Market
- Main characteristic of a perfectly competitive market
  1. Many buyers and sellers
  2. Trade identical products
  3. Each buyer and seller is a price taker
  4. Firms and enter and exit the market

## Do we have a perfectly competitive market

Example | Close to a competitive market because | different because
--- | --- | ---
Farmers market | 1,3 | 2 (could be same) 

## Perfectly competitive Firm' Demand

if firms are price takers, they must choose quantities

# Business Decision-Making

- Consider a fast food restaurant
- Lots of information needed. Lots of decisions regarding inputs
  - Labor
    - Workers
    - Shifts
    - Wages
  - Capital
    - Fryers
    - Milkshake machines
    - Cash registers
  - Other inputs
    - Food supplies
    - Napkins
    - Tables

## Production - definitions
Term | Definition
--- | ---
Factor of production | an input used in a good or service (workers)
Production | converts inputs to outputs by using technology
Short run | period of time when at least one factor of production is fixed
Long run | period of time where all inputs are variable

## Diminishing Marginal Product of Labor 
- Run a fast food restaurant. increases in input eventually cause output to input at a slower rate
  - Laborer 1: total output 5
  - Laborer 2: total output 15, increase by 10
  - Laborer 3: total output 30, increase by 15
  - Laborer 4: total output 42, increase by 12
  - Laborer 5: total output 52, increase by 10

- Why
  - workers per machine
  - information flows

## Illustration of Diminishing MPL
- Ex: garbage collection
  - Fixed
    - Capital
    - Garbage truck
  - Variable
    - Labor
    - Workers
  - Output
    - Trash can is picked up

## Cost Concepts – Short run
Concept | definition
Fixed cost | <ul><li>The sum of all payments for fixed input</li><li>FC = </li></ul>
Variable cost | <ul><li>The sum of all payments for fixed input</li><li>FC = </li></ul>
Average cost | Cost divided by quantity

## An example of Production and Costs in the Short Run
- Our model has:
  - A perfectly competitive market for bottles
  - A single product: bottles

- Two inputs
  - labor (variable)
  - capital (fixed in the short run) - 1 unit in example

- Price of input:
  - Wage: $12/day
  - Rent: $40/day

## Short run production and costs

Workers | Bottles per day | Fixed cost | variable cost | total cost | marginal cost
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
0 | 0   |   |    |    | -- |
1 | 80  |   |    |    |    |    
2 | 200 |   |    |    |    |    
3 | 260 |   |    |    |    |    
4 | 300 |   |    |    |    |    
5 | 330 |   |    |    |    |    
6 | 350 |   |    |    |    |    
7 | 362 |   |    |    |    |    

## Cost Curves

Workers per day | Bottles per day | variable cost | AVC | total cost | ATC | Marginal cost
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
0 | 0 | 0 |  | 40 |   |   |
1 | 80 | 12 | 0.15 | 52 | 0.65 |
2 | 200 | 24 | 0.12 | 64 | 0.32
3 | 260 | 36 |  0.135 | 76 | 0.292

## Margin and Average Relationship

## Well – Behaved Cost Curves

# Profit Maximization
- profit = total\_revenue - total\_cost
- profit = total\_revenue - (variable\_cost + fixed\_cost)

- To maximize profits, the firm must produce the quantity where the total revenue minus the total cost is greatest
  - if MR > MC, firm should
  - if MR < MC, firm should
  - if MR = MC, firm should

## Profit maximization for a competitive firm

## Profit Maximization & Competitive Firm’s Supply Curve
- Measuring profit
  - π = TR - TC = 
  - if P > ATC
    - firm will earn
  - if P < ATC
    - firm will earn
  - if P = ATC
    - firm will earn

## Profit as the area between price and average total cost

## Short run and long run decisions
- Shutdown
  - Short-run decision to not produce anything
    - During a specific period of time
    - Because of current market conditions
- Exit
  - Long-run decision to leave the market

## Shut-Down Decision
- Cost-Benefit principle applies even to losses
- Shut down if your losses are less than if you continued operating
- Shut down if  

# Long run equilibrium in a Competitive Market
- Long run: firms can enter and exit the market
- if existing firms make positive profit
- if existing firms make negative profit
- process of entry and exit ends when

## Long-run market equilibrium

(diagram)

# Producer Surplus
- Producer surplus is the difference between the market price and the seller's reservation price
- Producer surplus is the area above the supply curve and below the market price

(diagram): PS = 1/2 * (2.00 - 0) * (4 - 0) = 4 1000's $'s per day
