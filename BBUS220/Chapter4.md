# Elasticity

1. Define price elasticity of demand.
2. Calculate price elasticity of demand.
3. Understand how changes in price affect total revenue.
4. Define cross-price elasticity and income elasticity.

## Price elasticity of Demand

- A measure of responsiveness of quantity demanded to changes in price
- The law of demand
  - P -> Q 
  - gives us the direction
- Price elasticity of demand
  - measures the amount of change
  - gives us the 
- Demand is *elastic* ("sensitive" or "responsive") if following a price change
  - Q\_D changes significantly 
- Demand is *inelastic* (“insensitive” or “unresponsive”) if following a price change
  - Q\_D changes a small amount 
- Notation
  - ε = Percentage change in quantity demanded / Percentage change in price
  - ε = %ΔQd/%ΔP = ΔQd/Qd / ΔP/P
  - Qd and P are old quantity demanded and price
  - For small percent changes in prices (is apporximation)
  - Price elasticity of demand is **always** negative
- Example: Demand for Pizza

\* | Old | New | % Change
--- | --- | --- | --- 
Price | $1.00 | $0.97 | 3%
Quantity | 400 | 404 | -1%

ε = 3% / -1% = -3 -> |-3| > 1, therefore elastic

### Elastic Demand
- Quantity demanded is responsive to price
- %ΔQd > %ΔP
- ε > 1

### Inelastic Demand
- Quantity demanded is not very responsive to price
- %ΔQd < %ΔP
- ε < 1

### Unit Elastic Demand
- Price and quantity change by the same percentage
- ε == 1

## Price Elasticity: Graphical View 

E = P/Q * 1/slope

8/3 * 1/4 = 2/3 * 1 = 2/3 = 0.66 < 1, inelastic

## Price Elasiticy Pattern
- Price elasticity changes systematically as price goes down
  - Slope is the same for the demand curve
  - P/Q decreases as price goes down and quantity goes up
- At high P and low Q, 
  - Demand is elastic
- At the midpoint
  - Demand is unit elastic
- At low P and high Q, 
  - Demand is inelastic
- **Two special cases**
  - Perfectly inelastic demand (Ed = 0)
    - Vertical demand line
    - Regardless of price, same quantity (non-responsive)
  - Perfectly elastic demand (Ed = -inf, undefined)
    - Horizontal demand line
    - Regardless of quantity, same price (highly responsive)

## Price Elasticity and Slope
- At the common point,  demand is less price elastic for the steeper curve

## Elastic and Total Revenue

Elasicity | coeficcent | interpretation | example
-------- | --------- | ---------- | --------
Perfectly elastic | = 0 | price doesn't matter | saving a pet
relatively elastic | 0 > e > -1 | price is less important than qd | electricity
unitary
relativly elastic | -1 > e > inf | price is more importnat than qd | apple
perfecly elastic | e = inf | price is everything | $10 bill
