# Elasticity

1. Define price elasticity of demand.
2. Calculate price elasticity of demand.
3. Understand how changes in price affect total revenue.
4. Define cross-price elasticity and income elasticity.

## Price elasticity of Demand

- A measure of responsiveness of quantity demanded to changes in price
- The law of demand
  - P -> Q 
  - gives us the
- Price elasticity of demand
  - measures the amount of change
  - gives us the 
- Demand is *elastic* ("sensitive" or "responsive") if following a price change
  - Q\_D changes
- Demand is inelastic (“insensitive” or “unresponsive”) if following a price change
  - Q\_D changes
- Notation
  - ε = Percentage change in quantity demanded / Percentage change in price
  - ε = %ΔQd/%ΔP = ΔQd/Qd / ΔP/P
  - For small percent changes in prices
  - Price elasticity of demand is **always** negative
