## Honeybee Keeper - Negative Externalities
- Cost to society (of making honey is):
  - Private costs of the producers (MC)
  - the costs to those bystanders affected adversely by the negative externality (XC = external costs)

**When external costs exist, maximising private profits prodice more than the social equilibrium**

## Taxing a Negative Externalitu (internalizing externality)
- Private EQ = Private MC • D
- Social optimum = Socual MC • D
- Deadweight loss = Area (SocialMC, Demand, private quantity)
- Solution:
  - impose a "nuisance" tax of $1000/ton

## Honeybee Keeper - Negative Externalities
- Value to society (from beekeeping) is the sum of:
  - private value to the consumer of honey
  - plus the value to those farmers affected by bees pollinating their apple orchard (XB = external benifits)

**When external benefits exist, maximizing private profits prodices less than the social optimim**

## Subdidizing a Postive Externality
- Private EQ = Private MC • D
