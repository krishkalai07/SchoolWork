# Chaper 9: Games and Strategic Behavior

# Definitions
- Game theory is a formal way to analyze interactions among a group of rational players behaving strategical
  - Apply to monopolistic competition and oligopoly
- Players
  - firms, individuals
- Strategic behavior:
  - Complete set of contingent plans for playing the game
  - I know that you know that I know
- Payoffs for each possible outcome of the game

## Strategic interaction between firms
- Predatory pricing vs. intense market competition

- Predatory pricing
  - Firms set prices below AVC with the intent of driving rivals from the market
  - Illegal, but difficult to prosecute
- Examples
  - Wal-Mart is often assumed to be a predator but is never prosecuted
  - Microsoft was prosecuted eventually for tying, but not for predatory pricing

# Simple game
- 2 players
- 2 potential moves for each player / strategies
- 4 potential outcomes / payoffs
- Can easily outline the players, strategies and payoffs in a simple 2x2 matrix

## New toy example
- Cost to firm is $5
- Quantity to be sold: 60 toy
- Two firms will sell: Wal-Mart and Toys R U
- Can sell the toy at a high ($12.5/toy) or low ($10/toy) price
- If prices are the same, firms split the market. 
- If you are the low price firm, you get the lions share
 of the market and hence profit

## Possible outcoes
\- | Outcome1 | Outcome2 | Outcome3 | Outcome4
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
P\_TRU | $10 | $12.5 | $10 | $12.5
Q\_TRU | 30 | 30 | 60 | 0 |
Profits\_TRU | 150 | 300  | 0
P\_W-M | $10 | $12.5 | $12.5 | $10
Q\_W-M | 30 | 30 | 0 | 60
Profits\_W-M | 150 | 225 | 0 | 300

WM\\TRU    | Price high | Price low
--- | --- | ---
Price high | 225.225 | 0,300
price low | 300,0 | 150,150

PlayerA\\PlayerB | Rock | Paper | Scissors
Rock | 0,0 | -1.1 | 1,-1
Paper | 1,-1 | 0.0 | -1,1
Scissors | -1,1 | 1.-1 | 0,0

# Dominatnt Strategy Equilibrium
- Dominant strateg
  - a strategy that work better than any other one, no matter what the other player does
- If one exists, will play the dominant strategy... but, none may exist
- To simplify the game, eliminate dominated strategie
- Dominant strategy equilibrium – where each player 
follows a dominant strategy

# Is walmart OP af?

- ~~Walmart H 225 or 0~~
- Walmart L 300 or 150
- ~~ToysRUs H 225 0~~
- ToysRUS L 300 150

# Simpify the game

- Eliminate dominated strategies

## Nash Equlibrium (John Forbes Nash)
- Dominant Strategy Equilibrium occurs when:
  - each player follows his dominant strategy, regardless the other player’s strategies, if it exists
- Nash Equilibrium is any combination of strategies in which:
  - each player’s strategy is her or his best choice, given the other player’s strategies
- All dominant strategies are Nash Equilibriums but not vice versa

## Find the equilibrium

Down | 1,2 | _4_,1 | 3,_5_

## Cartel Pricing
- A cartel is a coalition of firms that agree to restrict
output to increase economic profit
- Example:
  - Two oil produces: Iran & Iraq
  - Each can produce either 2 or 4 million barrels per day
  - Iran can produce output at $2/barrel (ATC\_Iran)
  - Iraq can produce at $4/barrel (ATC\_Iran)
  - World output will be 4, 6 or 8 million barrels/day (Q\_TOTAL)
  - Price/barrel in these three scenarios  would be $25, $15, and $10 (P)
  - Both Iran & Iraq choose low production (Q\_Iran = 2, Q\_Iraq = 2) and world production is Q\_TOTAL = 4. What is the price of oil?
  - Iran's profits:
    - π = revenue-costs = 
  - Iraq's profits:
    - π = (25-2)\*2 = 46
    - π = (25-4)\*4 = 42
