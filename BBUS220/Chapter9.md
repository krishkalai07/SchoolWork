# Chaper 9: Games and Strategic Behavior

# Definitions
- Game theory is a formal way to analyze interactions among a group of rational players behaving strategical
  - Apply to monopolistic competition and oligopoly
- Players
  - firms, individuals
- Strategic behavior:
  - Complete set of contingent plans for playing the game
  - I know that you know that I know
- Payoffs for each possible outcome of the game

## Strategic interaction between firms
- Predatory pricing vs. intense market competition

- Predatory pricing
  - Firms set prices below AVC with the intent of driving rivals from the market
  - Illegal, but difficult to prosecute
- Examples
  - Wal-Mart is often assumed to be a predator but is never prosecuted
  - Microsoft was prosecuted eventually for tying, but not for predatory pricing

# Simple game
- 2 players
- 2 potential moves for each player / strategies
- 4 potential outcomes / payoffs
- Can easily outline the players, strategies and payoffs in a simple 2x2 matrix

## New toy example
- Cost to firm is $5
- Quantity to be sold: 60 toy
- Two firms will sell: Wal-Mart and Toys R U
- Can sell the toy at a high ($12.5/toy) or low ($10/toy) price
- If prices are the same, firms split the market. 
- If you are the low price firm, you get the lions share
 of the market and hence profit
