# Demand

1. Demand and Utility
2. The Rational Spending rule
3. Individual demand and the market demand curve
4. Consumer surplus

# Origins of Demand


## Needs versus Wants
- Needs are goods required for subsistence
  - Water, food, shelter, clothing
- Beyond subsistence, behavior is driven by wants
  - Steak, hamburger
- Wants and Demand
  - Unlimited wants
  - Limited resources
  - Prioritize wants

## Modeling Customer Satisfaction
- Utility
  - A measure of relative levels of satisfaction consumers enjoy from consumption of goods and services
  - Sometimes numerically quantified by a unit of happiness called a “util”
- Total utility
  - Overall amount of happiness from consumption
- Marginal utility
  - Additional utility gained from consuming one more unit of a good or service
- Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility
  - Generally marginal utility

- Man vs. Food
  - Total utility: total happiness from eating hamburger
  - Marginal utility: difference of each bite

Cones vs hour | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
Total utility | 0 | 50 | 90 | 120 | 140 | 150 | 140
Marginal utility | - | 50 | 40 | 30 | 20 | 10 | -10

- **Law of diminishing marginal utility**
  - Generally marginal utility declines

## Diamond-Water Paradox
- Paradox:
  - Water is essential to life, yet cheap
  - Diamonds are (almost) pragmatically useless, yet expensive
  - Do you get a higher marginal utility from an additional diamond or from an additional glass of water? water
  - Do enjoy more total utility from diamond consumption than from water consumption? water

# Budget Allocation - Optimizing consumption
- No Money Left On the Table Principle
  - Assume a fixed budget
  - Decide how much of each good to buy
  - Maximize utility when the marginal utility per dollar spent is the same for all goods
- **Rational Spending Rule**
  - MU\_A / P\_A == MU\_B / P\_B
  - (movie) MU / A < (concert) MU/A
  - Go to the concert more until they are equal


## Substitution Effect
- When the price of a good goes up, substitutes for that good are relatively more attractive. For example: If the price of vanilla ice cream goes up:
 - some buyers will buy less vanilla and more chocolate

## Income effect
- Changes in price affect the buyers' purchasing power. For example: If the price of vanilla ice cream goes down:
  - buying the same quantity of ice cream at a lower price will leave consumers with more income left over that they can use to buy more vanilla & chocolate

# Individual and Market Demand Curves
- The market demand is the horizontal sum of individual demand curves

# Consumer Surplus
- Graph of Marginal utility vs. Quantity demanded
- Consumer's surplus is the difference between the buyer's reservation price and the market price
- Market price is $6 for all sales
- How many units sold? 6 units
- Consumer surplus
  - From the first sale $5
  - Selling the second unit $4
- Total consumer surplus is $15

## Consumer Surplus of milk

- Price is $2 and quantity is 4000 gallons per day
- CS is the area between
  - Demand, Market price, Market Quantity

- The area is $2000
