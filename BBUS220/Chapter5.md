# Demand

1. Demand and Utility
2. The Rational Spending rule
3. Individual demand and the market demand curve
4. Consumer surplus

# Origins of Demand

## Needs versus Wants
- Needs are goods required for subsistence
- Beyond subsistence, behavior is driven by wants
- Wants and Demand

## Modeling Customer Satisfaction
- Utility
  - A measure of relative levels of satisfaction consumers enjoy from consumption of goods and services
  - Sometimes numerically quantified by a unit of happiness called a “util”
- Total utility
- Marginal utility
- Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility
  - Genrally marginal utility

## Diamond-Water Paradox
- Paradox:
  - Water is essential to life, yet cheap
  - Diamonds are (almost) pragmatically useless, yet expensive
  - Do you get a higher marginal utility from an additional diamond or from an additional glass of water?
  - Do enjoy more total utility from diamond consumption than from water consumption?

# Budget Allocation - Optimizing consumption
- No Money Left On the Table Principle
  - Assume a fixed Budget
  - Decide how much of each good to buy
  - Maximize utility when the marginal utility per dollar spent is the same for all goods
- **Rational Spending Rule**

## Subsitution Effect
- When the price of a good goes up, substitutes for that good are relatively more attractive. For example: If the price of vanilla ice cream goes up:

## Income effect
- Changes in price affect the buyers' purchasing power. For example: If the price of vanilla ice cream goes down:
  - buying the same quantity of ice cream at a lower price will leave consumers with more income left over that they can use to buy more vanilla & chocolate

# Individual and Market Demand Curves
- The market demand is the horizontal sum of individual demand curves

# Consumer Surplus
- Consumer's surplus is the difference between the buyer's reservation price and the market price
- Market price is $6 for all sales
- How many units sold?
- Consumer surplus
  - From the first sale 
  - Selling the second unit
- Total consumer surplus is
