# Efficiency, Exchange, and the Invisible hand in action

1. Accounting and economic profit
2. The market response to profits/losses
3. Consumer and producer surplus
4. Efficiency vs. equity
5. Government policies and market efficiency

# Account and Economic Profit

Term | Definition
--- | ---
Explicit cost | payments firms make to purchase <ul><li>hiring labor,renting land, products from other firms</li></ul>
Implicit costs | are the costs of the resources supplied by the firm's owners<ul><li>labor of owner, use of the owner's car, apartment</li></ul>
Accounting profits | most common profit idea AP = TR - EC
Economic profit | how much money is made over other jobs EP = TR - EC - IC

## Economic Profits Guide Decisions

- Pudge Buffet's decision: keep farming or quit?
  - Quit farming and earn $11,000 per year working retail
  - Fertilizer and insecticide $10,000
  - Total revenue is $22,000

Implicit costs | Accounting Profits | Economic Profit
--- | --- | ---
11000 | 12000 | 1000 |

EC = 10000

# Market Response to Economic profits
- in the short run, typical corn farms earn 0 profits

## Market Equilibrium
- Firms keep coming into the corn industry until the typical firm earns 0 economic profits
- How would the market respond to economic losses?

## Adjustments towards the Long Run Equilibrium
- Long run: firms can enter and exit the market
  - If P > ATC
    - Profit > 0
    - New firms enter the market
  - If P < ATC
    - Profit < 0
    - Firms exit the market
  - Process of entry and exit ends when (L.R equilibrium):
    - Firms: 0 economic profit (P = ATC)

## Graphical Representation of the Adjustments
- The market for haircuts is in equilibrium. Then demand for haircuts decreases.
- How is this change affecting the representative firm?
- The market?

## Two functions of price
1. Rationing function of price
   - distributes scarce goods to the consumers who value them most highly
2. Allocative function of price
   - directs resources away from overcrowded markets to market that are underserved

# Measuring consumer surplus (CS)
- Consumer surplus is the difference between the buyers reservation price and the market price

## Market demand and consumer surplus

## Measuring producer surplus
- Producer's surplus is the difference between the market price and the sellers reservation price

## Market supply and producer surplus

# Market efficiency
- Adam Smith: markets are automatically channeling self-interest toward socially desirable ends (the most efficient allocation of resource - **the invisible hand**)
- Economic well-being of a society (welfare)
  - Total surplus (W) = CS + PS
- Efficiency (Pareto efficiency) - property of a resource allocation
  - maximizing the total surplus (W)
- Equity
  - is the concept or idea of fairness in economics

## Consumer and producer surplus in the market equilibrium
- Total well-being - the sum of consumer and producer surplus - is the are between the supply and demand curves up to the equilibrium quantity

# Heating oil market

## Policy experiment 1: $1 price ceiling on heating oil

## Thought experiment: $0.50 Price ceiling on bread

Question | explanation
--- | ---
Will there be more or less bread for sale? |  
Will the size of a typical loaf change? | 
Will the quality change? | 
WIll the opportunity cost of finding bread change? | 
Would you buy illegal bread if you could? | 

## Example of price ceilings
- Rent control
  - imposing a price ceiling on apartments or housing
- Goal

## Policy Experiment 2: Taxes on sellers
- Tax program
  - sellers report sales in units to government
  - sellers pays a fixed dollar amount per unit sold
- a tax on the seller shifts the supply curve up by the amount of the tax (for each level of output, seller charges his marginal cost + tax)

## Tax on Avocado sellers

## Tax on avocado sellers and total surplus
- Before tax
  - consumer surplus = 
  - producer surplus =
  - total surplus = 
- After tax
  - consumer surplus = 
  - producer surplus = 
  - total surplus = 
- consumer and producer loss = 
  - tax revenue
  - net benefit

## Tax on avocado sellers and total surplus
- Deadweight loss is the reduction in total economic surplus that results from the adoption of a policy.

## Taxes and Price elasticity of demand
- In this case, the avocado tax was shared equally
  - buyers paid
  - sellers received
- in general, the amount of tax paid (the burden) by buyers and sellers depends on the price elasticity of demand
