# Market Response to Economic profits
- in the short run, typical corn farms earn

## Market Eqyulibrium
- Firms keep coming into the corn industry until the typical firm earns 0 economic profits
- How would the market respond to economic losses?

## Adjustments towards the Long Run Equilibrium
- Long run: firms can enter and exit the market
  - If P > ATC
    - Profit > 0
  - If P < ATC
    - Profit < 0
  - Process of entry and exit ends when (L.R equilibrium):
    - Firms:

## Graphical Representiaoin of the Adjustments
- The market for haircuts is in equilibrium. Then demand for haircuts decreases.
- How is this change affecting the representative firm?
- The market?

## Two functions of price
1. Rationing function of price
   - distributes scarce goods to the consumers who value them most highly
2. Allocative function of price
   - directs resources away from overcrowded markets to market that are underserved

# Measuring consumer surplus (CS)
- Consumer surplus is the difference between the buyers reservation price and the market price

## Market demand and consumer surplus

## Measuring prudcer surplus
- Producer's surplus is the difference between the market price and the sellers reservation price

## Market supply and producer surplus

# Market efficiency
- Adam Smith: markets are automatically channeling self-interest toward socially desirable ends (the most effiecent allocation of reource - **the invisible hand**)
- Economic well-being of a society (welfare)
  - Total surplus (W) = 
- Efficinecy (Pareto efficiency) - property of a resource allocation
  - maximizing the total surplus (W)
- Equity
  - is the concept or idea of fairness in economics

## Consumer and producer surplus in the market equilibrium
- Total well-being - the sum of consumer and producer surplus - is the are bteween the supply and demand curves up to the equilibruim quantity

# Heating oil market

## Policy expdriment 1: $1 price ceilig on heating oil

## Thought experiment: $0.50 Price cieling on bread

Question | explanation
--- | ---
Will there be more or less bread for sale? |  
Will the size of a typical loaf change? | 
Will the quality change? | 
WIll the oppotunity cost of finding nread change? | 
Would you buy illegal bread if you could? | 

## Example of price ceilings
- Rent control
  - imposing a price ceiling on apartments or housing
- Goal

## Policy experiment 3: Taxes on sellers
- Tax program
  - selelrs reposrt sales in units to government
  - sellers pays a fixed dollar amount per unit sold
- a tax on the selelr shifts the supply curve up by the amount of the tax (for each level of output, seller chargis his marginal cost + tax)

## Tax on Avocado selelrs

## Tax on avocado sellers and total surplus
- Before tax
  - consumer surplus = 
  - producer surplus =
  - total surplus = 
- After tax
  - consumer surplus = 
  - producer surplus = 
  - total surplus = 
- consumer and producer loss = 
  - tax revenue
  - net benefit

## Tax on avocado sellers and total surplus
- Deadweight loss is the reduction in total economic surplus that results from the adoption of a policy.

## Taxes and Price elasiticty of demand
- In this case, the avocado tax was shared equally
  - buyers paid
  - sellers received
- in general, the amount of tax paid (the burden) by buyers and sellers depends on teh price elasiticy of demand
