# Agenda

- Finish OS Evolution
- System Calls, Fork
- OS Component
- Shell

# Cloud

## Virtualizatoin
- Multiple OS images sharing same hardware
- Possibly as HW power/memory ingcreases
- VNWare, Hyper-V, IBM Interface
- Initially embraces by enterpises for resource sharing of expensive centeralized compuging
  - One large server
  - Services many users in a fully isolated manner
- Currently used by developers to hanve many images to work with
  - Checkpoint work
  - Share full environment
  - Alpha/Beta products
- Key enabling technology for cloud

## Cloud
- Centeralized compute managed by others
  - Drives down maintenance cost for user
    - Reduces IT department
    - Improves reliability
  - Economy of Scale
  - Made possible by
    - internet
    - SOA (Service Oriented Archetecture)
    - Virtualization
    - Advances in large scale HW
  - Key players: Amazon, Microsoft (Azure), Google, IBM
    - Battle of eco-systems
    - Devices/Services

## Cloud taxonomy

## Containers
- Virutalization in on-top of OS
- Used to create full development environments
