6. Protectionism: tariffs and import quotas (ch. 16)

# Production Possibilities Frontier (Curve)
- Production possibilities frontier (PPF or PPC)
  - Combinations of outputs that a society can produce if all of its resources are being used efficiently
- Produce two goods:
  - Pizza
  - Wings
- Assumptions of this model
  - Technology fixed
  - Resources fixed

```
quantity of wings
50 |\
   | \
   |  \
   |   \
   _____
        25
 quantity of pizza
```

#Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)
- Definitions
  - Unattainable point (50 wings and 10 pizzas)
  - Attainable point
    - Inefficient point (8 wings and 12 pizzas)
    - Efficient point (30 wings and 10 pizzas)
- Why is the PPF downward-sloping? Scarcity

# PPF and Opportunity Cost
- Opportunity Cost = giveup/make
- Opportunity Cost is what we give up as a result of an action
- What is the opportunity cost of making 1 pizza? 50 wings / 25 pizzas = 2 2ings
- What is the opportunity cost of making 1 wing? 25 pizzas / 50 wings = 0.5 wings

# The Principle of Increasing Opportunity Cost
- For an Economy, a more realistic PPF would be “bowed out.”

# Opportunity Cost for an Economy
- Law of increasing opportunity cost
  - As we produce more of good A, we have to give up increasingly larger amounts of good B.
- Why?

# The Dynamic Economy
- Changes in PPC occur over time due to
  - More resources
  - Improvements in technology & knowledge

- Neutral Technical Change: entire curve shifts out 
- Biased Technical Change: curve rotates out 

# Absolute & Comparative Advantage

Person | Pizzas | Wings
--- | --- | ---
Debra | 60 | 120
Mike | 24 | 72

- Absolute Advantage
- Who has the absolute in pizza? In wings?

- opportunity cost

Person | 1 Pizza | 1 Wings
--- | --- | ---
Debra | 2 | 1/2
Mike | 3 | 1/3

# Comparative Advantage
- Who has a comparative advantage in
  - Pizza?
  - Wings?
- Comparative advantage drives specialization

### Debra
- Draw the PPF for Debra
- What is her opportunity cost of 1 pizza? 2 wings
- What is her opportunity cost of 1 wing? 1/2 pizzas
- If Debra wants 40 pizzas what is the maximum amount of wings she can produce?

### Mike
-  Draw the PPF for Mike
- What is his opportunity cost of 1 pizza? 3 wings
- What is his opportunity cost of 1 wing? 1/3 pizzas
- If Mike wants 18 pizzas what is the maximum amount of wings he can produce? 18 wings

# Without Specialization and Trade

- Each person can only consume what they produce.

# With Specialization and Trade

Debra Pizza 60
      Wings 0

- Debra produces only pizza. If she keeps 41 pizzas how 
many can she give to Mike? 19 pizzas
- Mike produces wings. If he keeps 25 how many can he 
give to Debra? 47 pizza

# Terms of Trade

Person | Opportunity Cost | Ratio
--- | --- | ---
Debra | 1 pizza equals 2 wings |1:2 = 0.50
Terms of trade  | 1 pizza for 2.5 wings |  1:2.5 = 0.40
Mike | 1 pizza equals 3 wings | 1:3 = 0.33
- Terms of Trade: a trading ratio benefits both sides
- How much was traded in our previous example?
  - 19 pizzas for 47 wings ( 1 pizza for 2.5 wings)
- But, any terms of trade that are between the opportunity costs of the trading partners will work

# Consumption Possibilities Frontier (Curves)
- Trading Ratio: 0.40  (1 pizza for 2.5 wings)

# International Trade and Comparative Advantage
- Production possibilities curve shows the quantities of different goods that an economy can produce
- Consumption possibilities curve shows the quantities of different goods that a country could consume
- A closed economy (an economy in Autarky) is an economy that does not trade with the rest of the world 
- In an open economy, an economy that trades with other countries

# Benefit of Free Trade
- Free trade produces net benefits. Some gain; some lose
  1. Domestic consumers of imported goods
  2. Domestic consumers of exported goods
  3. Domestic producers of imported goods
  4. Domestic producers of exported goods
