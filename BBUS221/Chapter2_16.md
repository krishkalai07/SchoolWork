# Production Possibilities Frontier (Curve)
- Production possibilities frontier (PPF or PPC)
  - Combinations of outputs that a society can produce if all of its resources are being used efficiently
- Produce two goods:
  - Pizza
  - Wings
- Assumptions of this model
  - Technology fixed
  - Resources fixed

```
quantity of wings
50 |\
   | \
   |  \
   |   \
   _____
        25
 quantity of pizza
```

#Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)
- Definitions
  - Unattainable point (50 wings and 10 pizzas)
  - Attainable point
    - Inefficient point (8 wings and 12 pizzas)
    - Efficient point (30 wings and 10 pizzas)
- Why is the PPF downward-sloping? Scarcity

# PPF and Opportunity Cost
- Opportunity Cost = giveup/make
- Opportunity Cost is what we give up as a result of an action
- What is the opportunity cost of making 1 pizza? 50 wings / 25 pizzas = 2 2ings
- What is the opportunity cost of making 1 wing? 25 pizzas / 50 wings = 0.5 wings

# The Principle of Increasing Opportunity Cost
- For an Economy, a more realistic PPF would be “bowed out.”

# Opportunity Cost for an Economy
- Law of increasing opportunity cost
  - As we produce more of good A, we have to give up increasingly larger amounts of good B.
- Why?
