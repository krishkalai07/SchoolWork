# Where is all the currency

  - Much of the currency is held abroad
  - Much of the currency is held by drug dealers, tax evaders, and other criminals
- Currency – not a particularly good way to hold wealth
  - Can be lost or stolen
  - Doesn’t earn interest

# The Federal Reserve System
- Federal Reserve (Fed)
- Central bank, an institution designed to
  - Oversee the banking system
  - Regulate the quantity of money in the economy
  - The Fed – lender of last resort
- The Federal Reserve System
  - Federal Reserve Board in Washington, D.C.
  - Current chairman:
     - Jerome Powell
  - 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks

# The Fedeeral - Monetary Policy
- Monetary policy is managing the size of the nation's money supply (the Federal Open Market Committee)
- Fed’s primary tool:
  - open-market operation: purchase & sale of U.S. government bonds
    - open-market purchase
      - Fed buy bonds from banks <-> money (increase)
      - increase the money supply
    - open-market sale
      - fed sell bonds
      - decrase the money supply

# Banks and the Money Supply
- M = C + D
  - M -> money supply
  - C -> currecny
  - D -> demands deposits
- Reserves are deposits that banks have received but have not loaned out
- The simple case of 100% reserve banking: all deposits are held as reserves
- Money creation: fractional reserve banking
- Banks hold only a fraction of deposits in reserve
  - Reserve ratio is the minimum reserve set by the Fed (a secondary tool in controlling the money supply)
  - Reserve ratio = 1/10 (10 percent, R)

- example?
  - Original deposit = $100.00
  - First National lending = $ 90.00 [= .9 × $100.00]
  - Second National lending = $ 81.00 [= .9 × $90.00]
  - Third National lending = $ 72.90 [= .9 × $81.00]
  - ...
  - Money supply created by the banks = $1,000.00
- The money multiplier =
  - Amount of money the banking system generates with each dollar of reserves
- The higher the reserve ratio
  - The smaller the money multiplier
- Money supply created by banks = Origianl deposite * 1/R

# Money Supply at christmans
- Suppose the public hold $500 billion in cash and deposits at the banks $500 billion.  The reserve-deposit ratio is 0.20.
- The banks use the $500 billion to create money:
  - Money supply from banks = 500 * 1/0.2 = 2500
  - Total Money supply = currency + money supply from banks = 3000
- As Christmas approaches, consumers reduce bank deposits by $100 billion
  - Banks have $400 b in reserves; public holds $600 b cash
  - Money supply = 2600
- Reducing bank deposits reduces the money supply

# Bank runs and the money supply
- Bank runs
  - Depositors suspect that a bank may go bankrupt
    - “Run” to the bank to withdraw their deposits
    - Cannot satisfy withdrawal requests from all depositors
  -  When a bank run occurs the bank - is forced to close its doors
  - Complicate the control of the money supply
  - Great Depression, early 1930s
  - What about today?

# The Quantity Theory of Money
- Velocity: the number of times the average dollar bill changes hands in a given time period
- The quantity equation
  - M \* V = P \* Y
  - Money Supppy
  - P = price of output (CPI or GDP deflator)
  - Y = quantity of output (real GDP)
- example:  In 2009, the CPI was 2, the real GDP was 300 and the money supply was $100 billion
  - So, velocity V =
