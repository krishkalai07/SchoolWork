# The Labor Market (title)

# The Labor Market

- Labor market is an input market
  - Supply of labor
    - households
  - Demand for labor
    - firms
  - Equilibrium price
    - Wages
  - Equilibrium quanitty
    - Employment

# Wages and Demand for Labor
  - Marginal Product of Labor (MPL)
    - is extra output that an added worker generates
  - Diminishing returns to labor
    - Adding one worker incerases output but by less than the previous worker added
  - Value of Marginal Product (VMP)
    - is extra revenue that an added worker genererates
    - vmp = marginal\_prodcut\_labor * price

# Seattle Computers (SC)
- SC can sell all computers for $3000 each
- if the wage is 45000 how many workers are hired? 6 workers

Number of workers | Computers per year | Marginal Product | Value of Marginal Product
--- | --- | --- | ---
1 | 25 | - | -
2 | 48 | 48-25=23 | $3000\*23=69000
3 | 69 | 69-48=21 | $3000\*21=63000
4 | 88 | 19 | 57000
5 | 105 | 17 | 51000
6 | 120 | 15 | 45000
7 | 133 | 13 | 39000
8 | 144 | 11 | 33000

# Demand Curve for labor
- Hire and extra worker iff VMP > wage paid

- if wage is $60,000, SC will hire
  - 3 workers
- 50000 SC hires
  - 5 workers
- the lower the wage, the more workers employed

# Shifting Demand for Labor
- Demand shifts when the value of the marginal product of a worker changes
- Two factors determie the demand (VMP) of labor
  - The proce of the output
    - An indcrease in market demand
  - THe productivity of workers
    - new tech
    - org change
    - training and education

# Graph a shift
- If price of compiters increases to $5000
  - the damand for labor increases

# Individual Labor Supply
- REservation wage is the lowest wage a worker would accept for a given job
  - Opportunity cost of working is
    - your lesuire activity
  - Cost - benefit

# Aggregate labor supply
- Macroecon determinands of labor supply
  - Size of working age population
    - Domesting birthrate
    - Immigrateion and emigration
    - Ages when peple enter and reture frt the workforce
  - Share of working-age population willing to work
    - Wonens partipate in the labor force has increased in the last 50 years
  - A shift in labor supply is cause by any change in the number of workers willing to work at each wage

# Equilibrium in the labor mmarket
- Equilibrium real wage (W) is where supply=demand
- W1 is surplus of workers, so wages will fall

## Q24 on canvas (left and right shift)

# Increased Wage Inequality in the US
- Between 1960 and 2014
  - weekly earning of prod workers decreased
  - highest-skilled workers real wages increased

- **first cause: Globalizatoin**
Benefit | Cost
--- | ---
incrreased specialization and effiency based on comparative advanctage | Some domesting sectors shrink

- **Second cause: Tech changes**
  - Some innovation renders old skills less valuable
  - Luddites
  - Worker mobility is the movement of woerkers between jobs, firsms, and industries

## Homework 3 / Quiz 3

# Unemplyment
- Bureau of Labor Stats estimates employment and unemployment monthly
  - Employed
  - Unemployed (no job in last 4 weeks
  - Out of labor force (studens, retired, military, discouraged)
- Labor force = employed + unemployed
- Pop 16+ = labor force + out of labor force
- unemplyemtnr rate = unemplyed / lkabor force
- particpation rate labor force / 16+

# Unemployemetn Issues
- Duration of unemployment (len of unemployemtn spell)
  - Long-term: out of work for 6+ months (chronically enempl.)
- Discouraged workers would like to have a job but they have not looked for work in teh past 4 weeks
  - coutned as out of labor force
- Underemployed workers
  - involunatyr part-time workers are people who like to work full-time but cannot find a full-time job
  - overqualified wworkers for their job
  - counted as emplyed

# Costs of unemployment
- Economic costs
  - Lost wages and prodictsion
  Decrasde taxxes and inerasd transfers
- Psychologiecal costs
  - individual self-esteem
  - family stress
- Social costs
  - potential increases in crimes and socaial problems

# Three types of unemplyemnt
- Natural
  - Structural
    - long-term, chronic unemployment in well-functioning economy (high costs)
      - structual shifts in production create a long-term mismatch between workers and market needs
      - Lack of skills, language barriers, or discrimination
      - barriers to employment such as
        - minimum wage
        - unempliyment insurance
        - efficiency wages
        - unions
  - Frictional 
    - when workers are between jobs in a well functioning company
      - short duration, low economic cost
      - may increase economic efficiency
 - Example:
   - recent college grads
   - spouse of a person who moves for a new job
- unnatural
  - **Cyclical**
    - increase in unemployment during economic slow-downs
      - usually short duration
      - economic costs depends on length of cycle
    - example
      - due to economic slow-down and low demand, a company has to downsize

# Structural barriesr to unemplyemnt
- Labor union benefuts
  - Support progressive labor legislation
  - increase productivity
  - promote democracy in workplace
- Labor union costs
  - higher costs for companies
