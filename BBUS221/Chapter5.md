# Macroeconomcics and GDP
- Macroeconomics
  - The study of economy-wide issues. Key word is "aggregate"

Households <-- Income/Labor // Goods/Expenditure --> Firms

# Define
- GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is the market value of all final goods and services produced in a country in a given period of time

- Production Value = Expendeture = Income

Orcharida | Apples | Bananas | Shoes
--- | --- | --- | ---
Price | $0.25 | $0.50 | $20.00
Quantity | 4 | 6 | 3
GDP contribution | $1.00 | $3.00 | $60.00

- Orchadia's GPD is $64
- Weighs expensive items more
- US's norminal GDP in 2018 is estimated at $20.89 trillion,

# Market Value
- Only goods sold and bought in organized market will count towards GDP
- Non-market activities are not counted in GDP
- Some non-market goods are included in the GDP

# Final Goods and Services
- Final goods are consumed by the ultimate user
- Intermediate goods are used up in the production of final goods
- Goods can be sold as a final product or used as an intermediate good
  - Final: you buy milk from store
  - Intermediate: Store buys milk

# Produced in a Country in a Period of Time
- "Domestic" in GDP means the activity is measured within a country's borders
- Nationality of owners or company is not relevant
- Value must be produced in the year considered
- Sell a 20-year old house for $200,000 and pay$12,000 commission to the real estate agent
- How is the GDP affected by the sale?

# Measuring GDP – from theory to practice
- GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is the market value of all final goods and services produced in a country in a given period of time
Why is it difficult to measure a country’s GDP by following this definition?

# Measuring GDP

Sum of value added in all stages of production = Gov't purchase + investments + Consumption - Net exports = Labor Income - Capital Income

# Value Added approach to GDP (1st)
- Value added is the market value of the product minus the cost of inputs purchased from other firms
- Count value added in the year it is produced
- Hot'n'Fresh buys flour and other inputs to make bread that sells for $2.00

Company | Revenue | Cost of Purchaced Inputs | Value Added
--- | --- | --- |---
ABC Grain | 0.5 | 0.0 | 0.5
General Flour | 1.2 | 0.5 | 0.7
Hot'n Fresh | 2.00 | 1.2 | 0.8
Total |   |   | 2.0

#The expenditure components of GDP (2nd)
- consumption (C)
  - households
- investment (I)
  - firms and households
- government spending (G)
  - government
- net exports (NX)
  - foreigners

- Y = C + I + G + NX
- value of total output = aggreate expendeture

# Consumption (C)
- Final purchase of goods and services by households, with the exception of new housing
- durable goods
  - ex: cars
- nondurable goods
  - ex: food
- Services
  - ex: 

# Investment (I)
- Private spending on [the factor of production] capital. Investment is NOT “investing” in stocks and bonds
- Includes:
  - business fixed investment (capital goods)
    - Spending on plant and equipment that firms will use to produce other goods & services.
  - residential fixed investment
  - Spending on housing units by consumers and landlords.
- inventory investment
  - The change in the value of all firms’ inventories.

# Government spending (G)
- includes all government spending on goods and services...
- excludes transfer payments (e.g., unemployment insurance payments), because they do not represent spending on goods and services.

# Net Exports (NX)
- Net exports are exports minus imports
- Exports (EX)
  - Goods produces domestically and sold abroad
- Imports (IM)
  - are purchacses in the US of goods and services procuced abroad

# The Pieces of real GDP in 2017, Trillions of Dollars
Item | Price | Percent
--- | --- | ---
Consumption (C) | $13.39 | 69%
Durable Goods | $1.47
Nondurable Goods | 2.82
Services | 9.10
Investment (I) | 3.21 | 16.6%
Business Fixed Investment | 2.45
Residential Construction | 0.74
Change in Business Inventories | 0.02
Government Purchases (G) | 3.35 | 17.3%
Federal | 1.26
State and Local | 2.09
Net Exports (NX) | -0.57 | -2.9%
Exports | 2.34
Imports | 2.91
Total GDP | $19.38 | 100%

# Income Approach to GDP (3rd)
- When a good is sold, its proceeds are distributed to workers or business owners
- GDP = labor income + capital income
- Labor income is
  - wages, salaries, benefiets, and incomes of self-emplyed
  - 2/3 of GDP
- Capital income pays for physical capital and intangibles
  - Profits for business owener
  - Interest for bond holders
  - Rent for land
  - Royalties

. | Number of Pizzas | Price of Pizza | Munber of Calzones | Prices of Calzones
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
2019 | 10 | $10 | 15 | 5
2020 | 20 | $12 | 30 | 6
- 2019 GDP: 175
 -2020 GPD: 420
 -GDP in 2020 is 2.4 times the GPD in 2019
- Physical volime of volume: twice as many pizza and calzones
- Why a diff? price increases

# Calcualte Real DFP for 2020
Real GDP values output in the current year using the prices from the base year (use 2019 as the base year)
- Real GDP in 2019 is 175
- Real GDP in 2020 is 350
- Real GDP doubled between 2019 and 2020

# Nominal GDP and Real GDP
Nominal GDP values output in the current year using prices from the current year
Real GDP values output in the current year using the prices from the base year
Changes in nominal GDP can be due to: either
Changes in real GDP can only be due to: quantity

# Three uses of GDP Data
Why is GDP useful to examine?
1. Estimate living standards across time and nations
2. Measure economic growth
3. Determine whether an economy is experiencing a short-run expansion or recession

# Real GDP and Economic Well-Being
  - Real GDP is a flawed measure of well-being
  - Omits illegal transactions, volunteer work, and household production
  - does not value leisure
  - doesn’t measure income inequality
  - doesn’t take into account environmental quality
  - GDP does not account for intangibles people value

# Alternative Measures of Economic Well-Being
- Other measures of well-being
- Life expectancy
- Education levels
  - Access to healthcare
  - Crime rates
  - Environmental quality
- Reality
