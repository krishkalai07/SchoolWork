PAE = C + I^P + G + NX

## Consumption
- C = C\_bar + (mpc)(Y-T)
- C\_bar is autmonomous consumpotion spending (the wealth effect)
- T is net taxes
- Y - T is disposable income (DI)
- mpc is marginal prepensoty to consume

C\_bar = $100
mcp = 0.8
Y = $1200
T (net taxes) = $200

C = 100 + 0.8 * (1200 - 200)
C = 900

if income increase by 100: C = 980

PAE = C\_bar + mpc * (Y-T) + I^P + G + NX

PAE = 620 + 0.8 * (Y - 250) + 220 + 300 + 20
PAE = 960 + 0.8Y

# Short run equilibrium

Output (Y) | PAE | Y - PAE
4000 | 4160 | -160
4200 | 4320 | -120
4400 | 4480 | -80
4600 | 4640 | -40
4800 | 4800 | 0
5200 | 4960 | 40

# Income and Expenditure Multilpier

Multiplier = (1/(1-MPC))
The larger the MPC, the multiplier get larget
