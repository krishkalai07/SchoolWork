Chapter 6:  Measuring the Price Level and Inflation
1.
Consumer Price Index and the inflation rate
2.
CPI biases
3.
Inflation vs. relative price changes
4.
Inflation, nominal interest rates, and real interest rates

CPI is a maeasure of the overall level of prices
CPI prices
The cost of a standard basket of goods and services in a given year relative to the cost othe same basket  of goods and service in the base year

# Calculating the CPI
2000 Spending | Monthly Cost in 2000
Rent (2 bedroom apartment) | $500
Hamburgers (60 at $2 each) | 120
Movie tickets (10 at $6 each) | 60
Monthly expenditure | $680

2020 Spending | Monthly Cost in 2020
Rent (2 bedroom apartment) | $630
Hamburgers (60 at $2.50 each) | 150
Movie tickets (10 at $7 each) | 70
Monthly expenditures | $850

- CPI is the ratio of the cost of the basket of goods in current year to the cost in the base year
Base year (2000) cost 680
Current year (2020) cost 850
CPI = 1.25
CPI for the base year is always 1.0
Cost of living in 2020 is 1.25x higher than in 2000

#Inflation
The rate of inflation is the annual percentage change in the price level
Inflation = ((CPI\_Y2 - CPI\_Y1) / CPI\_Y1) * 100
Inflation in 2020
When inflation rates are negative there is deflation
Extremely high rate of inflation is hyperinflation  

# Correcting Economic Variables for Effects of Inflation
- To compare values over time:
  - Deflate the variables.
    - Express the variables in base year prices
    - Divide a nominal quantity by its price index to express the quantity in real terms
  - Index the variables
    - Express the variables in current prices
    - Increases a nominal quantity each period by inflation
    - Are Social Security payments indexed? What about the minimum wage?
